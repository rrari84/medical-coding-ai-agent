This is a form of Medicare fraud and abuse because it involves misrepresenting the level of service provided to receive higher reimbursement. This is not the same as billing for services not rendered (Option A), billing for unnecessary services (Option C), or assigning a lower code to save the patient money (Option D). The critical coding rules provided do not directly address this question, but as an expert medical coder, understanding the concept of upcoding is fundamental.",
